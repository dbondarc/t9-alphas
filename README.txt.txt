1) Unpack the zipped folder to your desktop so that the dictionary file is in the same folder as the index.html. 
2) Open the index.html file with any modern browser.
3) Use the virtual keypad to enter any number (up to 4-digits). The auto-suggestion box will show possible Alpha combinations based on your input.

Thanks,
